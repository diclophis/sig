* Made tagifyText work with IE. defaults to a style of "position: relative; zoom:1;" for the created SPAN wrappers. It also replaces spaces with non-breakable spaces.

* Moved setting focus in Autocompleter to updateElement function to make it overridable [Brian Palmer]

* Added special handling for style attributes to Builder [Michael Schuerig]

* Changed opacity=1.0 check back to be inline with its original (pre 1.5) implementation to prevent flickering in Firefox < 1.1 on opacity-based effects (this also fixes flickering with drag-and-drop, sortable lists and autocompleting text fields). Note that this potentially breaks correct colors in some situations. [thx to David Zülke]

  <script src="path/to/prototype.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  <script src="path/to/scriptaculous.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
  
  in the HEAD section of an HTML file is now all that's needed to include all of the script.aculo.us libraries, 
  given that they all can be accessed by the same path as scriptaculous.js is.

* Added new CSS/background color features to Ajax.InPlaceEditor [Jon Tirsen]

* Added unit test for Autocompleter, first Version

* Moved stuff that didn't belong into specific libs into util.js; util.js is now required for all script.aculo.us libs

* Added experimental "clone" option to Draggable to so that a "clone" stays in place while dragging a translucent version of the draggable element. Currently, this requires relatively positioned elements, and doesn't work with sortable lists (but should after some tweaking). See dragdrop_function_4.html test file for details.
