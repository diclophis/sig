== script.aculo.us web 2.0 javascript

The Web is changing. The 30-year-old terminal-like technology it was originally 
is gradually giving way to new ways of doing things. The power of AJAX allows 
for rich user interaction without the trouble that has bugged traditional 
web applications. 

Building upon the wonderful Prototype JavaScript library, script.aculo.us 
provides you with some great additional ingredients to mix in.
